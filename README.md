*Fun Dialogue*\
Evan: "I'm telling you! No EMUS or Kangaroos were harmed in the making of this production assignment."\
Professor: "Okay interesting, well why are the target names offset?"\
Evan: "You gotta play in full screen to fix it. I don't know why it did that."\
Professor: *plays and sees target names* "So did you order the attack on the Kangaroos and Emus?"\
Evan: "Of course not, obviously it was a hit by the mermaid mafia paid in leprechaun gold. But who was the puppet master? The unicorns? No, they've had a fued going with the mermaids for years."\
Professor: "Okaaay then."\
