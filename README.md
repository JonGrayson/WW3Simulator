*Disclaimer*/
L is to launch the projectiles, R is to reset them to original position. Target names are offset, game must be played in full screen to fix the issue. I have no idea why it did this, but it did.\ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ \

*Fun Dialogue*\
Professor: *plays and sees target names* "So did you order the attack on the Kangaroos and Emus?"\
Evan: "Of course not, obviously it was a hit by the mermaid mafia paid in leprechaun gold. But who was the puppet master? The unicorns? No, they've had a fued going with the mermaids for years."\
Professor: "Okaaay then."\
